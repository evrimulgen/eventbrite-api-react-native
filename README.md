# eventbrite-api-react-native
Testing and learning react native with app that interacts with eventbrite api,
to be honest nothing to see here its just me playing around learing React Native.
But if you like to install and see how it works see below...

## Install
1. Get the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/verybluebot/eventbrite-api-react-native.git
```
2. cd to root librery:
```
cd eventbrite-api-react-native
```
NOTE: asuming you have all your envirment set for React Native

3. Install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```
4. Run on ios/android
```
react-native run-ios // for ios
react-native run-android // for android
```
NOTE: for ios this will build, open Xcode and run the app for Android you will need first to open an emulator or connect your phone...

5. Enjoy :alien:
